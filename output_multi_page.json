Asset Management Asset Management is an essent ial part of effective health care Information Security management . Health care entities are witnessing an influx of new asset classes that are very different from the ones they used to deal with.  Innovative care delivery mandates that healthcare entities and professionals  deal with a large number of relatively small, mobi le and sophisticated pieces of equipment /devices, and to keep them running at all times as they are often critical to the patient\u2019s health, safety  and wellbeing . In order to be effective and supportive of organizational business and security objectives, healthcare entities shall maintain an updated version of asset inventory, available to relevant management, business and support stakeholders. Information assets includes information/data in all its form, as well as the underlying application, technology, a nd physical infrastructure to support its processing, storing, communicating and sharing. The following are considered information assets: \uf0b7 Information (in physical and digital forms) \uf0b7 Medical device and equipment \uf0b7 Applications and Software \uf0b7 Information System \uf0b7 Physical Infrastructure (Data centre, access barrios, electrical facilities, HVAC systems, etc) \uf0b7 Human resources (in support of care delivery) Objective: The regulatory structure surrounding nearly every facet of the healthcare operations, from protecting patient data and improving health outcomes, to reporting on compliance -related issues, necessitates healthcare entities to monitor and record the use of information assets .

Healthcare entity \u2019s management shall be aware that information security incidents may not always be preventable . But adequate procedures, process and technologies to detect, report  and hand le, combined education and awareness can minimize their frequency, severity and impact on an entity\u2019s asset, reputation, financial and legal values. It is essential that serious information security incidents that can potential ly disrupt critical b usiness processes and services are promptly communicated to the appropriate authorities so that they get involved early in the decision -making and communication. Objective : To ensure that healthcare entities define and utilize suitable process es and resour ces to identify and respond to information security and cyber security incidents, that they  are not severely impacted by incident outcomes and that they are able to restore affected operations within an acceptable timeframe.
