Information Security Incident Management The value of information has grown exponentially and has become a soft target for malicious intent communities, individuals and nation states to disrupt an organization\u2019s ability to conduct and sust ain business or to be in business, and to disrupt government\u2019s ability to provide services to its citizens and resident communities. Healthcare entit ies\u2019 utilization of technological advancement and innovation shall not be limited to service delivery ; rath er it shall also be to defend and respond to deliberate and accidental attempts to disrupt the entities\u2019  services. A healthcare entity\u2019s ability to quickly and confidently respond to and restore service disruption attempts contributes  the entity management \u2019s commitment to its vision and objective values towards service delivery. Healthcare entity \u2019s management shall be aware that information security incidents may not always be preventable . But adequate procedures, process and technologies to detect, report  and hand le, combined education and awareness can minimize their frequency, severity and impact on an entity\u2019s asset, reputation, financial and legal values. It is essential that serious information security incidents that can potential ly disrupt critical b usiness processes and services are promptly communicated to the appropriate authorities so that they get involved early in the decision -making and communication. Objective : To ensure that healthcare entities define and utilize suitable process es and resour ces to identify and respond to information security and cyber security incidents, that they  are not severely impacted by incident outcomes and that they are able to restore affected operations within an acceptable timeframe.
